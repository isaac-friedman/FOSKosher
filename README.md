# FOSKosher
The first-ever online open-source kosher cookbook!

---

### What is this?
The recent success of sites like Sepharia has shown that the open-source spirit is alive and kicking in the observant Jewish world, and what better way to utilize that collaborative spirit than to use it to help us all do what we all love to do: eat!

### Goals
The goal of this project is to create an online, collaborative repository of kosher recipes in the open-source spirit. That means that anyone can copy and use any of this information any way they want, and anyone can contribute to this repository to help make better kosher food for everyone.
The guidelines I am putting in place will ideally help to ensure ease-of-use and portability, and should also enable other uses for this information, such as third-party applications, analytics, and such.

### Guidelines
Here's where we get to the good stuff.
- The repository is organized in a carefully-constructed directory tree. Recipes go in the bottom-most directory that suits them. This is to ensure that similar recipes are grouped together.
- All recipes are to be formatted in GitHub-style Markdown. This is to ensure openness and compatibility.
- Recipe titles are to adhere strictly to the following format:
    - [Ease of Preparation]\[Total Prep Time][Recipe Name].md
        - Ease of Preparation should be either Beginner, Easy, Intermediate, Hard, or Advanced
        - Total prep time should be the start-to-finish time it takes to complete the recipe, formatted as hh-mm
            - For example, [02-45] indicates 2hrs and 45min prep time  
    - Adherence to this format ensures ease of finding a recipe that best suits the user's needs.
    - Make sure recipe names are descriptive, but avoid duplicates.
- All are welcome to submit their own recipes and suggest changes to others.
    - To submit your own recipes, BRANCH the repository, add your own, and submit a pull request. Keep your branch open, because that's how you will make changes to your own recipes.
    - Suggested edits and changes to other's recipes should be made by opening up ISSUES on the relevant files in the OWNER's branch, (not MASTER).
- For those who are unfamiliar with Git / GitHub / Markdown, but would still like to contribute, feel free to email your recipes to foskosher@gmail.com.
